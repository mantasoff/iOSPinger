# iOSPinger
This is a simple Pinger application for iOS. It's main goal is: scan the local network for reachabilities. Additionally to that, you can scan any host and get the reachability status. The project is based on the [Reachability.Swift](https://github.com/ashleymills/Reachability.swift) library.

## Getting Started
